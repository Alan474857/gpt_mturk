            Below, you will see a conversation between <span class="bold">a user</span> and <span class="bold">a non-human Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant</span>. 
            The user is asking the assistant for help with a question. 
            <div style="display:inline-block; height: 12px; width:100%;"> </div>
            <!-- The user's question to the assistant is: <span class="bold" style="text-decoration: underline;">"You will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called “Stable Diffusion”. "Stable Diffusion" AI generates images based on given prompts.
Below is a list of prompts that can be used to generate images with Stable Diffusion:
- Iron Man, (NAME_1, Toru Nakayama), Masterpiece, Studio Quality, 6k , toa, toaair, 1boy, glowing, axe, mecha, science_fiction, solo, weapon, jungle , green_background, nature, outdoors, solo, tree, weapon, mask, dynamic lighting, detailed shading, digital texture painting
- (NAME_2) wearing leather jacket is a DJ in a nightclub, mixing live on stage, giant mixing table, 4k resolution, a masterpiece
- cute girl, crop-top, blond hair, black glasses, stretching, with background by NAME_3 makoto shinkai kyoto animation key art feminine mid shot
- athena, greek goddess, claudia black, art by artgerm and NAME_3 and magali NAME_4, bronze greek armor, owl crown, d & d, fantasy, intricate, portrait, highly detailed, headshot, digital painting, trending on artstation, concept art, sharp focus, illustration.
- ancient indonesia, indonesian villagers, punakawan warriors and priests, cinematic, detailed, atmospheric, epic, concept art, wimmelbilder, matte painting, background mountains, shafts of lighting, mist,, photo – realistic, concept art,, volumetric light, cinematic epic + rule of thirds | 3 5 mm, 8 k, corona render, movie concept art, octane render, cinematic, trending on artstation, movie concept art, cinematic composition, ultra – detailed, realistic, hyper – realistic, volumetric lighting, 8 k
At a later conversation, I'll give you a paragraph and a name and you need to use the name to write me a clear first-person perspective prompt according to paragraphs. Follow the structure of the example prompts. This means a very short description of the scene, followed by modifiers divided by commas to alter the mood, style, lighting, and more and you can add other descriptions about people but don't add another element to the scene.

                Please read the conversation and rate its quality in terms of <span class="bold">Complexity, Connectivity, Dynamics, Intransparency, Multiple Goals, Achievability, Rephrasable, Persona, Reach-out, Conversibility, and Helpfulness</span>.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Complexity</span>: The question involves numerous variables that could impact the outcome. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Connectivity</span>: The relationships between the variables in the question are not straightforward, making it challenging to understand how they influence each other. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Dynamics</span>: The question evolves over time, and the answer may change as progress is made. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Intransparency</span>: There are multiple, potentially conflicting goals associated with the question, requiring a balance of priorities. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Multiple Goals</span>: Not all information needed to answer the question is readily available or clearly understood. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Achievability</span>: As the request is currently phrased, it would not be physically possible for an average person (non-expert in the specific field) to accomplish what the user requested within 20 minutes with decent quality. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Rephrasable</span>: The request is achievable for an average person (non-expert in the specific field), but the way it is currently phrased makes it challenging for a human to respond effectively. Some level of rephrasing is needed. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Persona</span>: The question requires the assistant to adopt or portray a specific type of persona rather than replying as a generalized personality. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Reach-Out</span>: If you have this question, you would reach out to other people, such as friends, family members, colleagues, or experts, to get help. As compared to finding the answers by looking up information by myself with a computer or a smartphone. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Conversability</span>: If you have this question, you would prefer to have a conversation regarding the details of the question and have a further discussion with the answerer. As compared to asking the question as is and waiting for the answers. </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Helpfulness</span>: At the end of the conversation, the assistant provided a helpful solution to the question initially asked. </li>
